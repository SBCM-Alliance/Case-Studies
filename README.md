## 📂 Overview
This repository serves as the **"Evidence Locker"** for the SBCM project.
It contains empirical studies, audit reports, and raw data sources (financial settlements) that validate the [SBCM Core Theory](https://github.com/SBCM-Alliance/core-theory).

Unlike traditional economic research, our methodology utilizes **AI-driven auditing** to extract thermodynamic anomalies from municipal financial reports.

## 📑 Case Studies List

| ID | Title | Target | Key Findings |
|:--:|:---|:---|:---|
| **001** | **SBCM Case Study_ Comparative Analysis of Fiscal Stagnation and Structural Wealth Extraction in Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi** | Tokyo Metropolis, Osaka, Aichi | $R_{fund} \approx 0.47$ (4x National Avg). Mathematical proof of a fiscal "Black Hole" structure. |
| **002** | **SBCM Case Study: Thermodynamic Classification of Standard Block Municipalities** | Standard Block Cities ($B_{std} \approx 70k$) | Polarization into "Heat Death" (Q4) or "Colony" (Q2). The "Ideal State" (Autonomy) is statistically a **Null Set ($\emptyset$)**. |

## 🛠 Data Availability & Reproducibility
We adhere to the principles of **Open Science**.
*   **Source:** Original PDF files (Settlement of Accounts) are stored in the `Evidence` directory of each case study.
*   **Method:** Extraction prompts and analysis logs are provided to allow anyone to reproduce the results using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Copilot).
